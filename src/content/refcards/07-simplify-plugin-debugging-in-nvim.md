## Simplifying Plugin Debugging in Neovim Using `enabled=false` in Lua

Debugging plugins in Neovim with Lua is streamlined using `enabled=false`. This feature allows you to disable plugins temporarily to troubleshoot issues or conflicts without uninstalling them.

## How to Use `enabled=false`:

1. **Access Your Lua Configuration:**
   Open your Neovim Lua configuration file (`init.lua`).

2. **Disable a Plugin:**
   Modify the plugin setup to include `enabled=false`. For example:
   ```lua
   return {
       'github/copilot.vim',
       enabled=false
   }
   ```

3. **Save and Restart:**
   Save the changes and restart Neovim. The specified plugin will not load on startup.

## Benefits:

- **Flexible Debugging:** Easily isolate and resolve plugin-related issues by disabling them temporarily.
  
- **Maintain Setup:** Keep your plugin configuration intact while debugging efficiently.

Using `enabled=false` in your Neovim Lua configuration provides a simple yet effective way to manage plugins during debugging, ensuring a smoother development process tailored to your requirements.
